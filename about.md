## Personal Trivia

I am a Colombian programmer & psychologist. My professional life consists mostly of participating in software development
projects where I have the chance to exercise functional programming. Nevertheless, psychology and philosophy are the
intellectual pillars that drive my reflection upon reality. After my psychology degree I didn’t really feel motivated
to exercise it as my main professional activity, primarily since I developed a fascination for the computational
way of approaching topics like *Cognitive Processes*, *Language*, *Perception* and so on and so forth. On the other hand, I had
already undertaken my engineering career, so I decided to focus on computers and software for a while in order to cultivate
a better understanding on how to integrate these two intellectual paths in an interesting, enjoyable and useful way.
Thus, one of my personal goals is to progressively turn my software engineering practice into an activity that has beneficial
effects on other people’s behavior and mindset--including myself.

## Current Work

Currently, I'm participating in the foundations of an exciting software product that aims to leverage
AI to improve people's routines and lifestyle. The name of this product is *Ziru* and is being developed at
[*Dodrotu Limited*](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/12434645). Moreover, this company
has a strong conviction on the exceptional capabilities that *functional programming* has to produce software that is elegant,
scalable and robust. That's why we are promoting a tech stack whose main players are *Haskell* and *Rust*.
